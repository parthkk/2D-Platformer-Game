# 2D-Platformer-Game
This video game was created by my friend Gordon and I. We hope you enjoy!

The project was used to strengthen my knowledge and apply the key concepts of Object Oriented Programming.
Key Concepts include: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance.

The aim of the game is to complete all the levels by working together with your partner. 
Player 1 Controls: WASD to move, "E" to fire weapon.
Player 2 Controls: Arrow Keys to move, "M" key to fire weapon.

GAME FEATURES:
1. Both players can double jump
2. Both players have a projectile. Player 1 kills enemies, Player 2 slows enemies down.

3. Enemies have a tracking system that allows them to follow the nearest player so they don't just move randomly

4. Gems and Stars are added into the game to provide a point system for players to try to get the most possible points <br/>
5. There are 8 different types of platforms/blocks you can encounter, each block has a different ability. Examples: slow player, kill player, bounce player into the air.
